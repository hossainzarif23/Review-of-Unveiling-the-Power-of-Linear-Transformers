# Review of Unveiling the Power of Linear Transformers
**Authors: Zarif Hossain (group 11)**
## Introduction
The blog "Unveiling the Power of Linear Transformers" is an attempt to introduce and explore the efficiency and versatility of linear transformers. The original transformer takes $O(n^2)$ memory due to the calculation of $QK^T$ matrix, where $n$ is the sequence length. That's why, a lot of people tried to approximate this quadratic attention through linear attention mechanism. 

The blog authors summarized the NeurIPS 2024 paper of [Linear Transformers are Versatile In-Context Learners](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=p1ft33Mu3J) and did an okayish job on breaking down the paper.

## Strength
- The blog clearly underlines the motivation of the linear transformers, quadratic complexity problem of traditional transformers and made a very strong case for adapting linear transformers as an alternative.
- The blog includes a breakdown of self-attention mechanism and kernelized self-attention mechanism and the intuitions were really solid.
- The blog underlined the objectives of the paper clearly, which gives a good starting point on the research question the paper addresses.

## Weaknesses
- The [blog](https://github.com/Superb-Man/blog) authors didn't introduce the mathematical setup for studying in-context learning in linear transformer. The experimental setup isn't understandable just by reading the blog alone. A breakdown on the data generation process, why they chose multivariate gaussian distribution to model the dataset, how this objective is ideal was much needed.
- Given that the audiences are undergraduate students, who have just finished machine learning course recently, a solid introduction of in-context learning could have been added.
- The authors didn't introduce the learning objectives for fixed noise varience scenarios and mixed noise varience scenarios.
- The blog didn't explain what each of the theorems and lemmas individually implies.
- Given that the paper is highly mathematical, a significantly more mathematical rigor was expected. The blog writers were expected to break down the assumptions and proofs of the theorems and lemma, the intuitions behind them, with relevant examples. The blog's purpose should have been to break down all the mathematical derivations to the ugrad students, who are the audiences here, so that they can have a much easier time reading this mathematically dense paper. This objective wasn't even tried to be addressed.
- A comparison table with the referenced papers would have strengthened the blog.

## Final Verdict
Given that the purpose of a blog on an academic paper is to help the readers understand the methodology of the paper, the author assumptions and the mathematical breakdown of a very mathematically dense paper, the blog authors did a poor job on addressing these objective.
